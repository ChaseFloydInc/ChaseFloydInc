			<center><h1>What is ChaseFloydInc?</h1></center>
			<center>
			<p>ChaseFloydInc, or CFI for short, is the name of Chase Floyd's Youtube Channel and the "company" behind all of the associated works hosted there. Founded by Chase Floyd (me!) in 2010, CFI began as just a place to upload some videos I had made for school projects. However, CFI soon evolved and developed into much more, for it became a place to share all of the latent ideas, goals, and potential I had residing within my mind for years. Flash-forward to the present day and CFI continues to grow and expand with new content uploaded every two weeks!</a></p>

			<center><p>The story of CFI is a complex one, but as is often the case when unwraveling anything one must go back to the very start. After uploading those school project videos, CFI remained dormant and I really did not have any concrete plans on what to do with my aptly named account. This all changed towards the end of my senior year in high school though. During my high school years I developed a very strong interest in fitness and exercise, and this consumed much of my free time. However, around the halfway point of my final year I discovered my passion for music as well. Discovering this was not easy though, since for some reason it had been ingrained in my mind that only people who were "music" people (people born with some kind of latent gift/talent) could play music (and only if they had started at a young age!). I held these same misconceptions about MATH as well (but how I overcame that is a story for another day!). I kept practicing though, and while progress was slow it was present nonetheless. Then one day, after noticing some good progress, I guess I just started wanting to not believe that these two things, music and math, along with pretty much anything else similarly considered could only be accomplished by people with "talent". I suppose I stopped believing in the idea of "talent" and started believing in the idea of "work". That is, with hard work and dedication one can accomplish ANYTHING they set their mind to! This truly was a seminal, life-changing moment in my life as I began to practice even more and before I knew I could say that I knew how to play the piano. I had become "learned", and it was through hard work and not because of some kind of latent ability. These two things, music and fitness, combined with my natural interest in being comedic and having fun led to the birth of CFI's first four "genres"; Music, Fitness, Comedy, and Fun!</p></center> 												
			<center><p>Once I had figured out this "genre-based" vision for where I wanted to take CFI, I worked non-stop to improve my fitness and musical skills since I knew it would open up many video filming opportunities and pathways. Equipped with my basic Casio LK-100 keyboard and a house full of exercise equipment, I began filming keyboard covers of songs along with myself doing Pull-Ups (my favorite fitness exercise to do!). I made progress quickly in both areas, creating several covers and also reaching the magical number 20, and it was thus during the Summer of 2011 that CFI finally got the Music and Fitness genres up and running with a couple of covers and a lot of pull-ups hitting the airwaves!</p></center>
			<center><p>During the Fall of 2011 I entered college, and fortune was on my side because my university had a palatial and (more importantly) public music program. This allowed me to finally start playing real pianos (and eventually grands as well!), and I thus spent at least an hour a day practicing in one of the music hall's practice rooms. This continued for many months, and I made several more music genre piano covers to go along with a few videos from the other genres. However, it was around December of 2011 that the fifth and final genre of ChaseFloydInc was born; CHALLENGE!</p></center>
			<center><p>Little did I realize it at the time, but all of the "learning", "experiencing", and "doing" that I had been practicing while working out, doing pull-ups, and learning how to play the piano would shape the person I am today and hope to keep improving upon for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed learning and doing these things so much, and the euphoric feeling I would get whenever I "crossed that point A to point B bridge" of not being able to do something and then being able to do it became addictive. I just couldn't get enough, but I wanted more than just pull-ups and piano. And that, is when it hit me. Growing up my father was always "good" at stuff. You name it, he was good at it. Sports, fishing, darts; he was just "good" at stuff, and it seemed like it was natural to him.
