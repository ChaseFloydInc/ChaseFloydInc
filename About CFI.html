			<center><h1>What is ChaseFloydInc?</h1></center>
			<center>
			<p>ChaseFloydInc, or CFI for short, is the name of Chase Floyd's Youtube Channel and the "company" behind all of the associated works hosted there. Founded by Chase Floyd (me!) in 2010, CFI began as just a place to upload some videos I had made for school projects. However, CFI soon evolved and developed into much more, for it became a place to share all of the latent ideas, goals, and potential I had residing within my mind for years. Flash-forward to the present day and CFI continues to grow and expand with new content uploaded every two weeks!</a></p>

			<center><p>The story of CFI is a complex one, but as is often the case when unwraveling anything complex one must go back to the very start. After uploading those school project videos, CFI remained dormant and I really did not have any concrete plans on what to do with my aptly named account. This all changed towards the end of my Senior Year in high school though. During my high school years I developed a very strong interest in fitness and exercise, and this consumed much of my free time. All of this working out did help lay the foundation for my current "growth oriented" mindset though, so combined with the exercise specific improvements I look back on this time as being productive. However, around the halfway point of my final year I discovered my passion for music as well...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>Discovering this was not easy though, since for some reason it had been ingrained in my mind that only people who were "musical" people (people born with some kind of latent gift/talent) could play music. I also thought, for some odd reason, that the people who were "musical" could only tap into these gifts if they started practicing at a young age. I had it in my mind that not only could I not learn how to play music because I was not naturally "talented", but also because I was already an "adult" (age 17-18 at the time). I held these same misconceptions about a few other things as well, such as MATH (how I overcame that is a story for another day), but despite thinking this I still really wanted to learn how to play an instrument since deep down some small part of my being kept telling me that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't true...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>I somehow ended up in the Jazz Band during my Senior Year as an elective, and despite playing around the some basic percussion instruments I really had no direction as to how to learn how to play a musical instrument (or even which to learn for that matter!). Guitar interested me, but what had really always perked my ears was the magical metallic vibrations of the piano. Thus, for my 18th birthday my father got me a Casio LK-100 Keyboard, and upon receiving it I was DETERMINED to "prove them wrong" by learning how to play it...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>Simply SAYING that you are going to learn something is far easier than DOING it though. Learning how to play the piano is difficult, and it requires a lot of patience and persistence, especially when using the basic piece of equipment that I had. Progress was thus slow at first, and my hands/fingers simply did not want to cooperate. I kept practicing though, and by the end of the school year I was able to play a few very simple songs. Upon seeing this, some good progress towards my goal, I started to really feel and believe that maybe those two things, music and math, along with pretty much anything else similarly considered, could be accomplished by anyone (not just people with "talent") if they were willing to put in some hard work. I suppose that this was the point in which I stopped believing in the idea of "talent" and started believing in the idea of "work". That is, with hard work and dedication one can accomplish ANYTHING they set their mind to!</p></center> 
															
	<center><p>This truly was a seminal, life-changing moment in my life. After this I began to practice piano even more during the hot, summer months that followed and (as I now say all of the time) "success bred success". Success truly does breed success, since before I knew it I could say with confidence that "I knew how to play the piano". Everytime I practiced and got a little bit better I was able to take that little bit of better and use it the next time I practiced to get even better. I had become "learn-ed", and it was due to hard work and not because of some kind of latent ability.</p></center>
	
	<center><p>Throughout this time I kept up with my exercising as well though, even hitting 20 pull-ups for the very first during late July of that year. This had been a long-time goal of mine, since I wanted to get onto the "Hall-of-Fame" on a website called "Twentypullups.com". This website even had a "YouTube" section in their Hall-of-Fame, designed for people who went one extra step and filmed themselves completing a set of 20, so I made sure to film myself hitting this magical number with the goal of uploading it to my dormant YouTube Channel. I did, and this marked CFI's first "serious" upload...</p></center>
	
	<center><p>During that summer, the Summer of 2011, I felt on top of the world. I was strong as an ox, and I had learned how to play a musical instrument. It felt great, and those months will forever remain as a special time in my mind since it marked the beginning of a "renaissance" in my life. A "rebirth" of Chase Floyd, if you will, into "ChaseFloydInc". I felt the need to share my musical progress with the world though, and that is when it clicked; Why not make some videos and upload them to YouTube! I did, making a few basic covers and a medley of myself playing piano on my old Casio keyboard, and the response I got from my friends and family was very positive.</p></center>
	<center><p>As I said before, "success breeds success". The positive responses I got for the handful of videos I created led me to want to do even more. However, college was on the horizon and I feared that I would have to leave everything that I had worked so hard on behind. I could not (at least I felt I could not) bring my keyboard with me, nor could I work out as much as I had been during a rigorous college semester. I felt a bit saddened that all of these new ideas might "die", but school always came first so off I went to college a bit conflicted as to how to feel.</p></center>
	<center><p>The first few days of college were...weird. Freshman arrived a week early to get acclimated to the campus, and needless to say I was a bit bored. I worked out as much as I could at the local playground (calisthenics!), but I still felt like I needed something else to do. Something to improve on, via practice. That something was music, piano, of course. I didn't have my keyboard though, but oneday while exploring the buildings on campus I discovered that I actually had something much greater. My college had FREE, PUBLIC access to their music hall. Most students did not know about this, and those that did were often too afraid to enter the music hall if they weren't music students. I could not resist though, and upon hearing this I just knew that I had to get in...</p></center>
	<center><p>I entered one afternoon yo a whoosh of cool air, and despite being scared and feeling out of place I quickly found a "practice room" to hide in. This room had all white, sound-proof walls and at the end of it lay the most magical upright piano I had ever seen. Up until that point I had never even touched a REAL piano before, but I knew that now was the time. I vividly remember walking up to it, sitting down, and starting to play some of the songs I had learned back during the summer on my Casio keyboard. That sound, that beautiful metallic sound, that echoed out of that upright piano will forever remain embdedd in my mind. I had never heard anything so beautiful in my entire life. Hearing a real piano, in realy life, being played, by yourself, for the very first time is incredible. Hearing it with fresh ears, as they say, is amazing. I henceforth began playing all of the songs I had learned, and I spent many hours there on that fateful day...</p></center>
	<center><p>Ideas started popping into my head left and right These two things I had been working on, music and fitness, combined with my natural interest in being comedic and having fun led to the birth of CFI's first four "genres"; Music, Fitness, Comedy, and Fun!</p></center> 												
			<center><p>Once I had figured out this "genre-based" vision for where I wanted to take CFI, I worked non-stop to improve my fitness and musical skills since I knew it would open up many video filming opportunities and pathways. Equipped with my basic Casio LK-100 keyboard and a house full of exercise equipment, I began filming keyboard covers of songs along with myself doing Pull-Ups (my favorite fitness exercise to do!). I made progress quickly in both areas, creating several covers and also reaching the magical number 20, and it was thus during the Summer of 2011 that CFI finally got the Music and Fitness genres up and running with a couple of covers and a lot of pull-ups hitting the airwaves!</p></center>
			<center><p>During the Fall of 2011 I entered college, and fortune was on my side because my university had a palatial and (more importantly) public music program. This allowed me to finally start playing real pianos (and eventually grands as well!), and I thus spent at least an hour a day practicing in one of the music hall's practice rooms. This continued for many months, and I made several more music genre piano covers to go along with a few videos from the other genres. However, it was around December of 2011 that the fifth and final genre of ChaseFloydInc was born; CHALLENGE!</p></center>
			<center><p>Little did I realize it at the time, but all of the "learning", "experiencing", and "doing" that I had been practicing while working out, doing pull-ups, and learning how to play the piano would shape the person I am today and hope to keep improving upon for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed learning and doing these things so much, and the euphoric feeling I would get whenever I "crossed that point A to point B bridge" of not being able to do something and then being able to do it became addictive. I just couldn't get enough, but I wanted more than just pull-ups and piano. And that, is when it hit me. Growing up my father was always "good" at stuff. You name it, he was good at it. Sports, fishing, darts; he was just "good" at stuff, and it seemed like it was natural to him.
