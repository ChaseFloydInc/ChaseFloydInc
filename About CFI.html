			<center><h1>The Story of ChaseFloydInc</h1></center>
			<center>
			<p>ChaseFloydInc, or CFI for short, is the name of Chase Floyd's Youtube Channel and the "company" behind all of the associated works hosted there. Founded by Chase Floyd (me!) in 2010, CFI began as just a place to upload some videos I had made for school projects. However, CFI soon evolved and developed into much more, for it became a place to share all of the latent ideas, goals, and potential I had residing within my mind for years. Flash-forward to the present day and CFI continues to grow and expand with new content uploaded every two weeks!</a></p>

			<center><p>The story of CFI is a complex one, but as is often the case when unwraveling anything complex one must go back to the very start. After uploading those school project videos, CFI remained dormant and I really did not have any concrete plans on what to do with my aptly named account. This all changed towards the end of my Senior Year in high school though. During my high school years I developed a very strong interest in fitness and exercise, and this consumed much of my free time. All of this working out did help lay the foundation for my current "growth oriented" mindset though, so combined with the exercise specific improvements I look back on this time as being productive. However, around the halfway point of my final year I discovered my passion for music as well...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>Discovering this was not easy though, since for some reason it had been ingrained in my mind that only people who were "musical" people (people born with some kind of latent gift/talent) could play music. I also thought, for some odd reason, that the people who were "musical" could only tap into these gifts if they started practicing at a young age. I had it in my mind that not only could I not learn how to play music because I was not naturally "talented", but also because I was already an "adult" (age 17-18 at the time). I held these same misconceptions about a few other things as well, such as MATH (how I overcame that is a story for another day), but despite thinking this I still really wanted to learn how to play an instrument since deep down some small part of my being kept telling me that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't true...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>I somehow ended up in the Jazz Band during my Senior Year as an elective, and despite playing around the some basic percussion instruments I really had no direction as to how to learn how to play a musical instrument (or even which to learn for that matter!). Guitar interested me, but what had really always perked my ears was the magical metallic vibrations of the piano. Thus, for my 18th birthday my father got me a Casio LK-100 Keyboard, and upon receiving it I was DETERMINED to "prove them wrong" by learning how to play it...</p></center>
																	 <center><p>Simply SAYING that you are going to learn something is far easier than DOING it though. Learning how to play the piano is difficult, and it requires a lot of patience and persistence, especially when using the basic piece of equipment that I had. Progress was thus slow at first, and my hands/fingers simply did not want to cooperate. I kept practicing though, and by the end of the school year I was able to play a few very simple songs. Upon seeing this, some good progress towards my goal, I started to really feel and believe that maybe those two things, music and math, along with pretty much anything else similarly considered, could be accomplished by anyone (not just people with "talent") if they were willing to put in some hard work. I suppose that this was the point in which I stopped believing in the idea of "talent" and started believing in the idea of "work". That is, with hard work and dedication one can accomplish ANYTHING they set their mind to!</p></center> 
															
	<center><p>This truly was a seminal, life-changing moment in my life. After this I began to practice piano even more during the hot, summer months that followed and (as I now say all of the time) "success bred success". Success truly does breed success, since before I knew it I could say with confidence that "I knew how to play the piano". Everytime I practiced and got a little bit better I was able to take that little bit of better and use it the next time I practiced to get even better. I had become "learn-ed", and it was due to hard work and not because of some kind of latent ability.</p></center>
	
	<center><p>Throughout this time I kept up with my exercising as well though, even hitting 20 pull-ups for the very first during late July of that year. This had been a long-time goal of mine, since I wanted to get onto the "Hall-of-Fame" on a website called "Twentypullups.com". This website even had a "YouTube" section in their Hall-of-Fame, designed for people who went one extra step and filmed themselves completing a set of 20, so I made sure to film myself hitting this magical number with the goal of uploading it to my dormant YouTube Channel. I did, and this marked CFI's first "serious" upload...</p></center>
	
	<center><p>During that summer, the Summer of 2011, I felt on top of the world. I was strong as an ox, and I had learned how to play a musical instrument. It felt great, and those months will forever remain as a special time in my mind since it marked the beginning of a "renaissance" in my life. A "rebirth" of Chase Floyd, if you will, into "ChaseFloydInc". I felt the need to share my musical progress with the world though, and that is when it clicked; Why not make some videos and upload them to YouTube! I did, making a few basic covers and a medley of myself playing piano on my old Casio keyboard, and the response I got from my friends and family was very positive.</p></center>
	
	<center><p>As I said before, "success breeds success". The positive responses I got for the handful of videos I created led me to want to do even more. However, college was on the horizon and I feared that I would have to leave everything that I had worked so hard on behind. I could not (at least I felt I could not) bring my keyboard with me, nor could I work out as much as I had been during a rigorous college semester. I felt a bit saddened that all of these new ideas might "die", but school always came first so off I went to college a bit conflicted as to how to feel.</p></center>
	
	<center><p>The first few days of college were...weird. Freshman arrived a week early to get acclimated to the campus, and needless to say I was a bit bored. I worked out as much as I could at the local playground (calisthenics!), but I still felt like I needed something else to do. Something to improve on, via practice. That something was music, piano, of course. I didn't have my keyboard though, but oneday while exploring the buildings on campus I discovered that I actually had something much greater. My college had FREE, PUBLIC access to their music hall. Most students did not know about this, and those that did were often too afraid to enter the music hall if they weren't music students. I could not resist though, and upon hearing this I just knew that I had to get in...</p></center>
	
	<center><p>I entered this palatial building one hot afternoon to a whoosh of cool air, and despite being scared and feeling out of place I quickly found a "practice room" to hide in. This room had all white, sound-proof walls and at the end of it lay the most magical upright piano I had ever seen. Up until that point I had never even touched a REAL piano before, but I knew that now was the time. I vividly remember walking up to it, sitting down, and starting to play some of the songs I had learned back during the summer on my Casio keyboard. That sound, that beautiful metallic sound, that echoed out of that upright piano will forever remain embdedd in my mind. I had never heard anything so beautiful in my entire life. Hearing a real piano, in realy life, being played, by yourself, for the very first time is incredible. Hearing it with fresh ears, as they say, is amazing. I henceforth began playing all of the songs I had learned, and I spent many hours there on that fateful day...</p></center>
	
	<center><p>This became my haven while away at college. I was never a big socializer, so this appealed to me far more than any party or club ever would. Once the semester started I began making trips to the music hall at least once a day (usually after dinner at the dining hall!) to practice for AT LEAST an hour (usually more!). One the weekends I would make several trips, staying for several hours. I played and played, practiced and practiced, and learned and learned. I learned many new songs, and the urge to film some of them soon re-entered my mind. I had left my camcorder back at home though, but fortunately my roommate at the time allowed me to borrow his. With it I filmed my first "official" entry into what is now known as the "CFI Music Genre", my "Lavender Town" cover. This is still my highest viewed video, and one of my favorites since the old piano I filmed it on helps make it seem perfectly eerie. I wanted to film more though, so when I returned home for Thanksgiving that year I made sure to bring my camcorder back with me...</p></center>
	
	<center><p>After returning to finish up my first semester, I filmed a couple more piano covers and received very positive feedback from my friends and family yet again. I knew I had to keep improving at piano though, but I now also wanted to expand CFI's offerings as well. Ideas on how to do so started popping into my head left and right, and before I knew it I had formulated a plan. CFI would have different "genres" of content, kinda like "stations" within my "channel", focused on different things I liked to do. Those two things that I had been working on, Music and Fitness, combined to make the first two genres. My natural interest in being comedic and having fun led to the birth of CFI's third and fourth genres, and with this CFI's first four "genres" had been created; Music, Fitness, Comedy, and Fun!</p></center> 												
			<center><p>Once I had figured out this "genre-based" vision for where I wanted to take CFI, I kept working to improve my fitness and musical skills since I knew it would open up many video filming opportunities and pathways for those two genres. This led me to create and film several more "batches" of covers on the upright pianos at my university's music hall, garnering good viewership and response from the public. I also began production on another fitness video detailing the "City Park" workout I was using while at college. In addition to this I began tapping into some ideas I had for Comedy videos by making a skit in which I "interviewed" another "Chase Floyd". However, while I had many ideas for "Fun" videos the story behind the very first one (myself juggling Poké Balls) commands a detailed explanation...</p></center>
			
			<center><p>Little did I realize it at the time, but all of the "learning", "experiencing", and "doing" that I had been practicing while working out, doing pull-ups, and learning how to play the piano these past few months would shape the person I am today and hope to keep improving upon for the rest of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed learning and doing these things so much, and the euphoric feeling I would get whenever I "crossed that point A to point B bridge" of not being able to do something and then being able to do it became addictive. I just couldn't get enough, but I wanted more than just pull-ups and piano. And that is when it hit me like a ton of bricks...</p></center>
			<center><p>Growing up, and even today, my father was always "good" at stuff. You name it, he was good at it. Sports, fishing, darts, pool; he was just "good" at stuff, and it seemed like it was natural to him. Even stuff he had never done or practiced before, like a random board-walk game. I began thinking about WHY he was so good at everything, especially things that were new to him. There had to be a reason, since I had just debunked the idea that only people with in-born gifts could accomplish certain things. I began thinking in my mind that maybe people who seem to do most thing well, and more importantly new things well, have a lot of EXPERIENCE LEARNING how to DO new things in general. I then thought to myself that if I just PRACTICED how to do things, by learning, experiencing, and DOING as many NEW things as possible that I too could become "good" at everything, just like my dad. It was then, around December of 2011, that the fifth and final genre of ChaseFloydInc was born; CHALLENGE!</p></center>
			<center><p>CHALLENGE is a nine letter word that has become doctrine in my life. This concept would become the focal point of CFI's fifth genre, and eventually CFI itself. Upon further refining my idea to have myself LEARN, EXPERIENCE, and DO as many new things as possible I developed the "100 Challenge". The concept behind the "100 Challenge" is a life-long program designed to challenge oneself to learn, experience, and do 100 challenging new things that they could not do before and that most people have not accomplished. The idea is "list-like" yet elegantly simple in that practitioners ideally write down things they want to do onto a list at the start, and then one-by-one for the rest of their life work on learning, experiencing, and doing those things (and anything else they added along the way!). I fell in love with this idea, for it not only translated perfectly to film and opened up many new ideas for making YouTube videos, but it also allowed me to keep doing "point A to point B" things (something in which you cannot do at all and then with practice can do).</p></center>
			<center><p>Once I had this idea in my mind, my own "list" became flooded with ideas for potential challenges. The very first one I had though, "Learn How To Juggle", would be the first "test" as to whether or not I was even worthy of undertaking the creation of the 100 Challenge. I had to again prove to myself and the world that I could learn how to do something that I had no ability whatsoever to do, and failure was not an option since the idea of the 100 Challenge depended on ME doing A LOT of challenges!</p></center>
			<center><p>I began practicing immediately, and by this time it was almost Christmas time. The second idea I had for a challenge was a musical one, "Learn How To Play Guitar", so for Christmas I asked my father for a guitar. He got me one, and I thus began pracitcing how to play guitar as well. There I was, January of 2012, not a year-removed from being just some kid obsessed with working out, sitting in my house practicing piano, juggling, and guitar all in one day while also working out and working on new ideas for videos. Needless to say, Chase Floyd's renaissance was in full-swing...</p></center>
			<center><p>Upon returing for my second semester that Winter, I kept up with my practicing and my school work. I had a clear vision of what lay ahead for CFI, and I worked on reaching that vision every single day. I had an EPIC idea for a Fun Video (My Best Friend Plank!), and I wanted to begin filming some footage for my eventual first entries into CFI's Challenge genre, but weather and school caused these things to be pushed off for a few months. I did however film a juggling video (myself juggling Poké Balls) since I felt that I needed something in the Fun genre (and I just couldn't resist!) and I released it around the time I released my first comedy video (The Interview)!</p></center>
				<center><p>Times were good at CFI. I was brimming with ideas (I always am!), I was working and making progress on new videos every day, and I was getting a decent amount of views. I was having fun, learning and practicing new things, nursing my calluses (guitar fingers!) and loving every second of life. By the time the Spring Semester was winding down though, I was excited for the Summer ahead since I knew it would be my chance to film more material. It was around this time that yet another idea for a challenge "wheeled" into view...</p></center>
				<center><p>The Summer of 2012 was a special one, for not only did I create the aforementioned Fun genre video with "my best friend", but I also completed and filmed my first three challenges; Juggling, Guitar, and Learning How to Ride a Unicycle. This third challenge, Unicycling, was by far the most difficult thing I had learned how to do in my life up to this point. I remember countless dusty, hot Summer days outside using the "ladders" to help me learn. These were halcyon days and the prime of the renaissance of Chase Floyd. The Challenge genre was thus released in the later portion of the Summer of 2012, right before I headed back to college to start my sophmore year...</p></center>
			
			
			Life is full of new and interesting things that with a little hard work anyone can achieve. It is never too late to learn something new, even if you've tried it before and given up! Anyone can change the perceptions about themselves and conquer anything! Never again accept the idea that you have "failed" at something, because with hard work and determination you can change anything about yourself by taking up a challenge! If you have any personal weaknesses or regrets, simply take up the challenge to change things because it is never too late! If someone else can do something, so can you! You'll be amazed at how much you'll learn and change from doing a challenge! Learning something as simple as juggling can give someone the confidence to someday climb Mt. Everest! With the 100 Challenge one will always be evolving and striving to conquer the next challenge!
									    
									    
									    
									    Equipped with my basic Casio LK-100 keyboard and a house full of exercise equipment, I began filming keyboard covers of songs along with myself doing Pull-Ups (my favorite fitness exercise to do!). I made progress quickly in both areas, creating several covers and also reaching the magical number 20, and it was thus during the Summer of 2011 that CFI finally got the Music and Fitness genres up and running with a couple of covers and a lot of pull-ups hitting the airwaves!</p></center>
			<center><p>During the Fall of 2011 I entered college, and fortune was on my side because my university had a palatial and (more importantly) public music program. This allowed me to finally start playing real pianos (and eventually grands as well!), and I thus spent at least an hour a day practicing in one of the music hall's practice rooms. This continued for many months, and I made several more music genre piano covers to go along with a few videos from the other genres. However, it was around December of 2011 that the fifth and final genre of ChaseFloydInc was born; CHALLENGE!</p></center>
