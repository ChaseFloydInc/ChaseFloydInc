																	    <p><i>The 100 Challenge is a life-long program pioneered by Chase Floyd that is designed to challenge oneself to learn, experience, and do 100 challenging new things that they could not do before and that most people have not accomplished. The 100 Challenge encourages you not to ask "why bother", but to instead ask "why not!" Life is full of new and interesting things that with a little hard work anyone can achieve. It is never too late to learn something new, even if you've tried it before and given up! Anyone can change the perceptions about themselves and conquer anything! Never again accept the idea that you have "failed" at something, because with hard work and determination you can change anything about yourself by taking up a challenge! If you have any personal weaknesses or regrets, simply take up the challenge to change things because it is never too late! If someone else can do something, so can you! You'll be amazed at how much you'll learn and change from doing a challenge! Learning something as simple as juggling can give someone the confidence to someday climb Mt. Everest! With the 100 Challenge one will always be evolving and striving to conquer the next challenge!</i></a></p>
																	    <p>I wrote that preceding exercept years ago back when I began the 100 Challenge, and I still post it along with each new challenge video I create. I like it, and I think that it cuts no corners in fully describing how I felt then and feel now about my 100 Challenge. How this all came to be is quite the story though, and definitely worthy of its own page!</p>
