																	    <p><i>The 100 Challenge is a life-long program pioneered by Chase Floyd that is designed to challenge oneself to learn, experience, and do 100 challenging new things that they could not do before and that most people have not accomplished. The 100 Challenge encourages you not to ask "why bother", but to instead ask "why not!" Life is full of new and interesting things that with a little hard work anyone can achieve. It is never too late to learn something new, even if you've tried it before and given up! Anyone can change the perceptions about themselves and conquer anything! Never again accept the idea that you have "failed" at something, because with hard work and determination you can change anything about yourself by taking up a challenge! If you have any personal weaknesses or regrets, simply take up the challenge to change things because it is never too late! If someone else can do something, so can you! You'll be amazed at how much you'll learn and change from doing a challenge! Learning something as simple as juggling can give someone the confidence to someday climb Mt. Everest! With the 100 Challenge one will always be evolving and striving to conquer the next challenge!</i></a></p>
																	    <p>I wrote that preceding exercept years ago back when I began the 100 Challenge, and I still post it along with each new challenge video I create. I like it, and I think that it cuts no corners in fully describing how I felt then and feel now about my 100 Challenge. How this all came to be is quite the story though and definitely worthy of its own page!</p>
																	    <h2>2011: The Idea is Born</h2>
			<p>For one to truly understand how the 100 Challenge came into existence, one must know a little about how CFI was born as well. I thus encourage readers to read about the history of ChaseFloydInc by clicking the "About" link on the CFI HomePage in order to get the complete picture. As I stated there, working on developing CFI really did open a lot of doors and without CFI's presence as a place to share videos and motivate the creation of them the 100 Challenge would not exist.</p>
			<p>I first got the idea for the 100 Challenge in December of 2011. I still remember this moment in my life vividly, for it remains in my mind as the culminating apex to what was a very powerful year in my life. I began the year 2011 as a high school senior who lacked any concrete direction in life but instead posessed an obsession with exercise and working out. I had not applied myself in school for years, becoming a student full of wasted potential. I had zero musical knowledge or ability, and aside from some cobbled together videos I had made for school projects nothing going on in the videography department. I did however at least have a part of me that possessed a burning desire to become something...anything...so long that it was "great". I ended that year as a college freshman with burgeoning piano skills, a ton of ideas for making good videos, and a 4.0 GPA. I also now had a VISION for where I wanted the newly created CFI to go, and by extension how I wanted my life to go. I was a changed man, for the better, and heck; I never stopped working out so I could still do 20 pull-ups to boot!</p>
			<p>For much of the the second half of that senior year (2011), I still had a mindset that only people with some kind of latent, in-born "talent" could do things like play a musical instrument or display a proficiency in academic subjects like mathematics. I also thought that these people could only utilize their abilities if they had started practicing at a young age. I truly believed this, and it negatively affected my life by causing me to fear things like these and back away from them. This all changed though when a peer of mine openly claimed that I "could not learn an instrument". Hearing someone say this out loud, something that I would never want to admit I thought might be true, hit me like a ton of bricks. It angered me. I wanted to prove these people wrong. And by these people I do not just mean that particular person, but people who have this mindset in general. I just wanted to prove them all wrong...</p> 
			<p> Well, so what you might ask. I had this chip developing on my shoulder, but chips of this kind are useless unless you actually use them to DO something about what you might view as an insult to your spirit. I knew this then, so I thus sought to DO something about my current predicament. And that something, as you might imagine, was LEARNING how to play a musical instrument just to prove that guy wrong. Just to prove all of them wrong, but to also prove it to myself that it could be done. Sure, I held this notion that people without latent "talent" could not do certain things in life no matter what. I also thought that when it came to music (and math for that matter) that adults had "missed the window" to learn these things for they could only be mastered if one starts at a young age.  At this time I myself was 17 years old, essentially an adult, so what chance did I have? Despite all of this I still felt something, something deep down inside of my soul, that told me that I had to try since "maybe, just maybe, this isn't the case"...</p>
			<p>After thinking all of this through and becoming determined to learn how to play a musical instrument, I first had to figure out which one I wanted to play. I was in the Jazz Band my senior year, but don't let this fool you into thinking I had any musical ability. I enrolled in this class as an easy elective, and aside from banging on the bongos I was pretty much just there for the show. Being there exposed me to the different types of instruments though. I thought the drums were cool, guitar seemed complex but worthwhile, and the saxophone reminded me of some good music from my youth. One instrukment stood out though, and it was this one that I knew was meant for me. This instrument, with its magical metallic clangs, was none other than the noble piano. Something about the piano just seemed right. It sounded so nice, and so many of my favorite songs utilized it despite my having never realized it. I knew I had found my match, so I began reading and researching a bit about it in an attempt to learn the basics. I had to actually have a piano to practice though, so for my birthday that year I asked my father for and received a Casio LK-100 keyboard. A basic machine, yes, but perfect for a beginner hungry to learn...</p>
			<p>My birthday is in late April, but the same day I received the machine I began practicing furiously. Progress was slow at first, as it often is, but as I say "success breeds success" so before long I had begun to notice some improvements. By the end of the school year I was already beginning to play some basic songs in entirety, and I had begun recording them on the sound recorder my phone had to share my progress with others. By the time gradution rolled around I began noticing changes in my entire mood and outlook just from learning the little bit of piano I had. This, the simple act of learning something new, had brought a lot of positivity into my life in a very short time. I had not expected this, but I sure did like the feeling...</p>
			<p>I was very excited for the following Summer, but I was also very worried about my future. College held so many unknowns, and I was loving my newfound musical life so much that I didn't want to leave. I kept on practicing piano that Summer, slowly but surely improving with each passing day. I kept up my exercising as well, focusing specifically on my Pull-Ups. I had made it a goal to do 20 Pull-Ups, since if I posted a video of myself doing so I could get on the "Hall-of-Fame on a website called "Twentypullups.com". I planned to upload the video to the YouTube account I had created to upload a few videos I made for school projects called "ChaseFloydInc". I eventually did get to 20 Pull-Ups in late July, making the video and earning a spot on the website. I was so proud of myself for I had not only proven the notion wrong that "untalented adults" could not learn how to play a musical instrument, but I had also reached one of my big-time fitness goals.</p>
			<p>I had a very strong desire to do more with videography though, since I felt that a lot of positivity could be spread with it, so not long after making the 20 Pull-Ups video I sought to create a few piano videos of myself playing. I did just that a few weeks later, also uploading them to ChaseFloydInc. It was during these weeks that I started to have a lot of ideas, a vision if you well, for where I wanted to take CFI. As I began compiling all of my video ideas I created the "genre" schematic for CFI, christening "Music" and "Fitness" as the first two official genres due to the recent uploads I had created.</p>
			<p>By the end of that magical 2011 Summer, I was on top of the world. I was in great shape, a beast at pull-ups, and I was also a brimming with musical potential with the clear mind that playing music brings. Everything was about to come crumbling down though, or so I thought, since I had to leave everything behind and go to college. I could not bring my keyboard to college, since how on Earth would I be able to even find time to play it? I also could not bring my workouts, since they were quite time consuming and involved. I suppose I still had some concreteness left in my mind, for I truly did believe that CFI was going to end here befor it could really even begin...</p>
			<p>Upon arrving at college I would soon find out how wrong I was. Freshman arrived a week earlier, giving them time to just explore the campus and the surrounding areas. I fully utilized this freedom, discovering a local abandoned playground that I and my workouts would soon call home. I also discovered "The Palace", which was what I called the university's music hall. This hall was, unbeknownst to almost all non-music majors, completely public and open to ALL students at ALL hours. When I found this out I just KNEW that I had to get in. I will never forget the first day I walked into that palacial building. The ivory walls, the whoosh of cool air; all of it remains with me. The walk up to the first practice room, and real upright piano, I had ever seen is something that remains a part of me. Pressing those keys for the first time and hearing those amazing metallic vibrations fill the room was simply magical. Once I was in, I did not want to leave. I practiced for hours that day, refreshing my skills and re-learning the many songs I had left behind. Every successive day, sometimes more than once per day, I'd go to that music hall to practice and learn more songs. I was in piano heaven...</p>
